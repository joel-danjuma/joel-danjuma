### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Joel Danjuma - a full-stack web developer with three years of hands-on experience. I have a deep interest in open source technology and I am constantly exploring new opportunities to expand my knowledge.

My journey as a Web Developer started as an intern at Lightech Consulting. There, I honed my skills in crafting search engine optimised content, where I utilised HTML, CSS, and React to create functional static web pages.

At Gwaree Foods, I developed an E-commerce application from scratch, using TypeScript, NextJS, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. I employed Clerk Auth to make authentication seamless while ensuring robust database structuring using Prisma ORM and optimised SEO with NextJS Metadata API and Open-graph standard.

At Biild, I led the development of a sleek web application using TypeScript, NextJS, and Tailwind CSS. I focused on modern UI/UX paradigms with Next-UI and Framer Motion, and also integrated an efficient email response service using Resend API, streamlining user engagement.

My key skills are Typescript, JavaScript, Python, NextJS, ReactJS, Prisma, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, REST API, and Cloud deployment (AWS, Digital Ocean, Vercel).
